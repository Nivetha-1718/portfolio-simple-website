# My Portfolio Website

This is a simple portfolio website that I created using HTML and basic CSS. It consists of two main pages:

- **Home Page**: An introduction to who I am, featuring my background, skills, and interests.
- **Contact Page**: A straightforward way for visitors to reach out to me, including my email and social media links.

This project highlights my foundational web development skills and my attention to clean, minimalistic design.

Feel free to explore, and I welcome any feedback!
